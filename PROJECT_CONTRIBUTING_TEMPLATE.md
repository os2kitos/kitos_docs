# Contributing to OS2 Documentation

Contributors to the documentation can be project managers, technical editors, developers, and end-users.  We welcome all contributions that help improve our documentation.

To ensure our documentation stays resilient and up-to-date, we employ the use of the open practice of [Docs As Code](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/docs-as-code/) and the open [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format for ease of collaboration and quality control.

To promote digital sovereignty, interoperability, reuse, transparency and resillience, we adhere to the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/), a framework maintained by the [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net/who-we-are/).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. Start by writing a README following the simple criteria in the above guides from Standard for Public Code. For at fast and simple way to accomplish this, you can fill out the placeholders in the PROJECT_README_TEMPLATE.md and [rename it](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/renaming-a-file) to README.md, replacing the Quick start guide for this template with your projects information.
2. Follow the criteria from [Document the Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-the-code.html), [Document your codebase objectives](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-codebase-objectives.html) and [Document codebase Maturity]()
   in one or several text documents using the Markdown format.
3. Document further suggestions and improvements by [raising issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) and describing what needs to be fixed, describe the user stories and potential delivered values.
4. Participate in issue discussions to help reach the correct resolutions. If you have the required knowledge about a part of the project, suggest yourself as an [assignee to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users#about-issue-and-pull-request-assignees).
5. Collaborate on documentation branches with issues assigned to you by the maintainers.
